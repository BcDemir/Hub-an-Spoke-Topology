Project #5

In this project I implemented Azure Hub and Spoke topology for network traffic

First I created virtual networks and subnets and, their NSGs.
Then, I created peering between vnet1 to vnet2 and vnet1 to vnet3
2 virtual machines are created in subnet0 and subnet1
Disassociated vm's public ips
Load balancer created and vms added to backendpool
